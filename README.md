# Assignment : Multi-threaded Bank System Simulation
## Objective:
To design and implement a simulated bank system using a programming language of your choice that demonstrates the use of multiple threads, synchronization mechanisms, monitor pattern for resource management, thread lifecycle management, thread groups, and ensures thread safety across various banking operations. 
(The assignment specification should be designed with Java in mind as it is the preferred programming language by the module leader. However, using other programming languages will not be a disadvantage).
